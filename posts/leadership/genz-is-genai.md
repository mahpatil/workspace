I used to think I was the teacher.

Turns out, I was the student. 🎓

A few months ago, Sudarshan walked into my office.

Not to ask for help. Not to request guidance. But to show me a better way to approach our generative AI tooling.

Now, Sudarshan is what many would call "entry level."

But here's the thing: **Gen Z doesn't see AI as a tool to learn. They see AI as a native language.**

While my generation is busy figuring out prompts and workflows, they're already three steps ahead — experimenting, breaking things, rebuilding them smarter.

We've got this backwards.

We treat Gen Z like they need hand-holding. Like they're "entitled" for asking questions or expecting autonomy.

But maybe — just maybe — they're not entitled.

Maybe they're **insightful**.

Maybe they see the friction we've normalized and aren't afraid to call it out.

Maybe their fresh perspective isn't a bug — it's a feature.

The best lesson on AI I ever got?

It didn't come from a conference. Or a senior architect. Or a $5,000 course.

It came from someone 15 years younger than me, who wasn't weighed down by "how we've always done it."

**Gen Z isn't just entry-level talent.**

**Gen Z IS Gen AI.** 💡

Same fresh energy. Same disruption of old patterns. Same refusal to accept that "this is just how things are."

So here's my question for you:

When's the last time you sat down and genuinely asked your youngest team member what THEY think?

Not as a mentorship exercise. Not to check a box.

But because you actually wanted to learn.
