# LinkedIn Post Outline: Gen Z is Gen AI

## Category: Leadership
## Issue: workspace-mnq

### Hook Options:
1. "I used to think I was the teacher. Turns out, I was the student."
2. "The best lesson on AI I ever got came from someone 15 years younger than me."
3. "Stop calling them 'entitled.' Start calling them 'insightful.'"

### Story Arc:
- Setup: Sudarshan, a "junior" team member, teaching me about AI approaches
- Contrast: Traditional management view vs. reality of Gen Z expertise
- Insight: Gen Z isn't just entry-level labor — they're entry-level expertise
- Challenge: The "hand-holding" stereotype is wrong; they need autonomy, not micromanagement

### Key Points to Include:
1. Gen Z brings fresh, unencumbered perspective on AI/tech
2. My personal story: Sudarshan teaching me (reversal of expected roles)
3. They're not trainees — they're contributors with valuable insights
4. Especially strong on AI/GenAI (native digital fluency)
5. Challenge the "entitled" stereotype — it's actually insight and confidence

### Takeaway:
- Flip the script: What can YOU learn from the newest member of your team?
- Gen Z = Gen AI = fresh perspective on the future of work
