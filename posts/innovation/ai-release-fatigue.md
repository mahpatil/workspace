Another week, another "state-of-the-art" AI model breaking benchmarks. 🏃‍♂️

---

Gemini this week.

Claude last week.

The week before? Some new coding model that promised to replace developers.

I wake up every Monday bracing for the announcement. Another model. Another leaderboard. Another round of "WE'VE CRUSHED THE BENCHMARKS."

---

Can I be honest?

**I'm exhausted.** 😮‍💨

Not from using AI. From *keeping up* with AI.

The pace isn't innovation anymore — it's noise. A relentless drumbeat of FOMO designed to make yesterday's model feel obsolete.

---

Here's the question everyone's asking:

**"What's the best model?"**

And the honest answer?

There isn't one. Not objectively. Not sustainably.

The "best" model depends on what you're building. Who you're building with. What you actually understand well enough to trust in production.

---

**My unpopular take:**

The best model isn't the one that tops the leaderboard.

It's the one you actually use.

The one your team has tested. The one you've broken and fixed and learned. The one that's shipped something real.

---

Benchmarks don't build businesses. 🚀

Users don't care about your MMLU score. They care if your product works.

So here's my Monday resolution:

Stop chasing every new release like it's oxygen.

**Start shipping.**

The model you have right now? It's probably enough to build something that matters.

---

What about you — are you feeling the AI release fatigue? Or am I just getting old? 😅

Drop a 🔥 if you're choosing shipping over chasing.
