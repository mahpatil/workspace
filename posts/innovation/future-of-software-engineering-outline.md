# The Future of Software Engineering — LinkedIn Post

## Outline

### Hook
- Two signals dropped in the same week that changed how I think about engineering teams
- Contrast: Million-line codebase with zero manually-written code vs. rebuilding Next.js in a week for $1,100

### The Developments
1. **OpenAI's HarNESS Engineering**
   - 0 lines of manually-written code
   - 1M lines of agent-generated code
   - 3.5 PRs per engineer per day (increasing as team grew)
   - Agents running 6+ hours unsupervised

2. **Cloudflare's vinext**
   - One engineer + AI rebuilt Next.js in one week
   - Cost: ~$1,100 in tokens
   - 4x faster builds, 57% smaller bundles
   - 94% API coverage

### The Realization
- Software engineering isn't dying — it's being redefined
- The "AI replaces engineers" narrative misses the point
- What actually changes: team size, not talent requirement

### Personal Take/War Story
- The best engineers I've worked with were force multipliers
- AI is just extending that leverage
- Quality bar isn't lower — if anything, it's higher
- You're not competing with AI; you're competing with engineers USING AI

### The Shift
- Big teams → Small elite teams
- Code monkeys → System designers
- Manual execution → Intent specification
- Writing code → Building environments for agents

### Call to Action
- Learn AI tooling or become obsolete
- This isn't coming — it's here
- The engineers who thrive are the ones who adapt
